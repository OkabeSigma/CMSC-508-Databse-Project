# CMSC-508-Databse-Project
At most hotel guests have to valet their cars upon arrival. Unfortunately, this task of
having a car valeted can become incredibly problematic. Most problems arise from a guest losing
their ticket (either leaving it in their room or losing it all together), a poorly kept ticket log at the
valet desk (missing information about guests and corresponding car), and car damages (who to
blame. The guest of the valet attendants). The objective of this project is to store information
about the valet cars, hotel guests, valet attendants, prior car damages, and shift information in an
effort to speed up car retrievals, correctly bill guests, pay valet attendants, and keep track of who
works when and hold employees accountable for vehicle damages. We are not concerned about
the hotel side of things, such as what food they order and the total cost of their stay at the hotel.
The only hotel information we are interested in is the guestâ€™s room number, room phone
number, name, arrival date, and departure date so they can be billed for the number of days their
car was parked. Guest information consists of first name, last name, guest ID, arrival date,
departure date, room phone number, and room number. Car information consists of the license
plate, ticket number, manufacturer, model, color, year, vehicle damage, car type (SUV, truck or
sedan), car transmission (automatic/manual), fuel (electric or gas) and parking level. Valet
attendant information consists of first name, last name, employee ID, and transmission comfort.
Shift information consists of shift ID, employee ID, start time and end time. Damages consist of
